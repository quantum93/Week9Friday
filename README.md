#### _Independent Project for Week 9 at the coding school, Epicodus, written on July 26, 2019._

## Description

_You met a developer at last week's meet-up and followed up with her via email. Her company isn't hiring at the moment, but she's volunteering on the side at an educational non-profit that needs help building a learning website for kids. The project is unpaid but it's a worthwhile cause, a chance to make connections, and an opportunity to build your portfolio further.

The concept for the website is to make learning fun: children will write up a list of words they don't know (but would like to learn) and then come up with their own definitions. Once you complete the basic objectives, you have an additional challenge: make this the best website for kids you can!

Make an application that contains a Word class. The homepage of the app should list all words. When a word is clicked, it should lead to a page with the word's definitions. Children should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add, update or delete one or more definitions. This week you should deploy your application to Heroku so the kids can try it out!_
